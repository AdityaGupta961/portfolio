                <p>Hey there! I'm Aditya, a developer who loves tackling complex problems and making technology work for people. My journey in tech has been filled with diverse projects, from building practical tools that improve daily workflows to creating engaging and intuitive user experiences.</p>
                <p>I had a great time at Deloitte, where I developed systems that made expense tracking straightforward and efficient. My projects are in multiple domains ranging from building a e-commerce clone in react to crafting an AI App that with specialized features that's both smart and user-friendly in Flutter. I'm all about finding the balance between functionality and simplicity.</p>
                <p>Versatility is one of my strengths. Whether it's diving into machine learning research (with a published paper to my name), developing apps with Flutter (with apps published on the Play Store), or working on full-stack web development, I enjoy challenging myself across different domains. I'm adept at both front-end and back-end development, always eager to learn and adapt to new technologies.</p>
                <p>That being said I don't just code all day :P, I enjoy playing the guitar, staying updated with the latest tech trends, and occasionally getting lost in a good sci-fi series. I believe in continuous learning and enjoy exploring new challenges that push my skills further. Let's connect and see how we can create something amazing together!</p>
